You will need some more software in order to develop a proper enterprise application:</p><ul><li>.NET Framework</li><li>Database</li><li>Web Server</li><li>Source files versioning system (optional)</li></ul><p>You can see how all these components work together on this diagram:</p><p> </p><div class="task last-task-theory ng-scope ng-binding"><div class="header_1_class">ORIGAM Architect</div><p>Architect is a visual development tool that will help you reduce the time to deliver your application greatly.</p><p>Most of the times it will allow you to <strong>design/model</strong> your application <strong>instead of coding.</strong> </p><p>ORIGAM Architect is a Windows desktop application and it stores the results of its work in:</p><ul><li>Model Database</li><li>Source files versioning system</li></ul></div><p class="submission_text"> </p><div class="task last-task-theory ng-scope ng-binding"><div class="header_1_class">Database</div><p style="color: rgb(255,0,0);"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">As enterprise applications typically heavily depend on storing and retrieving data, you will need to store these data somewhere.</span></p><p>Fortunately, there exist databases, so ORIGAM can use them.</p><p>As enterprise companies typically use Microsoft stack, ORIGAM's favorite database is <strong>Microsoft SQL Server</strong> at the moment.</p><p>You need to have a running installation of SQL Server before installing ORIGAM. If you do not have one, you can download a free SQL Server Express Edition.</p><p>What do we store in the database?</p><ul><li>Application's model</li></ul><p>The model contains whatever functionality you modeled using ORIGAM Architect. Whether it is a screen, API or a part of the business logic, everything is stored in a database. In a programmer's world we would call it a source code.</p><div class="header_2_class"><ul><li>Application's data</li></ul></div><p>These are the data your application will <strong>produce.</strong> These can be an address book, task list, etc.</p><p> </p><div class="task last-task-theory ng-scope ng-binding"><div class="header_1_class">Web Server</div><p>A web server is a piece of software running on your physical server that allows web browsers to communicate with your web application. It handles lots of different things like HTTP, Cookies, Sessions, etc. You do not have to necessarily understand all that.</p><p>Think of it as a <strong>host</strong> which will deliver all the requests made by the client application running in the user's browser to the application you have made.</p><p>Again, since we will be serving a Microsoft world mostly, ORIGAM's favorite web server is <strong>Microsoft Internet Information Services</strong> or <strong>IIS.</strong></p><p>IIS is a part of your Windows Server or Windows operating system and you need to install it before installing ORIGAM.</p><p> </p><div class="task last-task-theory ng-scope ng-binding"><div class="header_1_class">.NET Framework</div><p>.NET is a piece of technology developed by Microsoft which allowed us to develop ORIGAM. It is mostly a part of Windows and Windows server, but sometimes we run on the latest version and you will have to download it from Microsoft  and install it.</p><p>If you are a developer, you can extend ORIGAM by writing your own .NET modules. Otherwise you just need to have it installed.</p><p> </p><div class="task last-task-theory ng-scope ng-binding"><div class="header_1_class">ORIGAM Application Server</div><p>Not enough servers? There is one more, no less important.</p><p>ORIGAM Application Server is a piece of software that will run inside the IIS Web Server and it will <strong>connect all the pieces:</strong></p><ul><li>Load the model you developed using Architect.</li><li>Communicate with the client's browser.</li><li>Process all the business logic you designed.</li><li>Retrieve/store data in the database.</li></ul><p>Application server will <strong>execute your application</strong> (in the good way).</p></div><p> </p><div class="task last-task-theory ng-scope ng-binding"><div class="header_1_class">Client Application</div><p>A client application is a piece of software the users will work with. Unless you will go into the challenge of developing your own custom HTML frontend, your users will work with a <strong>standardized productivity oriented desktop-like application.</strong></p><p>Along the standard <strong>web based application</strong>, you will also have a possibility to provide your customers with a <strong>Native Windows Desktop Application</strong> which can be <span>convenient</span> in offline or local networks scenarios.</p></div></div><p> </p><div class="task last-task-theory ng-scope ng-binding"><div class="header_1_class">Source Files Versioning System</div><p>You do not write much of a typical source code with ORIGAM since it is a Model Driven tool but there is something we borrow from the software development world. We are developing a software anyway, right?</p><p>Imagine the following scenarios:</p><ul><li>You developed a feature and the customer decides to throw it away.</li><li>You tried something, it did not work and you want to go back to the previous state.</li><li>A new feature is being developed but you do not want to give it to the customer yet. But you need to fix bugs in the current version anyway.</li><li>You are not alone and you have to work in a team where multiple people develop the application.</li><li>Something changed and you want to know who it was and what exactly they did.</li></ul><p>All of this is being solved by a source control management system. Our favorite is <strong>GIT.</strong></p><p>Using <strong>GIT </strong>you will store all your development efforts in its repository along with the model database.</p><p> </p><h2 class="ng-binding" id="Installation(SettingThingsUp)-PlatformSetup">Platform Setup</h2></div></div></div><div class="task last-task-theory ng-scope ng-binding"><p>This lesson will guide you through the ORIGAM Platform installation. After the installation you will need to set up your first project. This lesson covers only the installation itself.</p><p>In order to install ORIGAM platform you need to go through the following steps:</p><ul><li>Check 3rd party software prerequisites (<a href="http://learn.origam.com/ec4573"  >see a list of bundled and needed parts</a>).</li><li>Download ORIGAM installation package.</li><li>Go through ORIGAM installation procedure.</li></ul><p>In the end you will have the following components installed:</p><ul><li>ORIGAM Architect modeling environment</li><li>ORIGAM Server template</li><li>Microsof SQL Server database ready for your first project</li><li>Web Server (IIS) ready for your first project</li></ul><div class="task ng-scope ng-binding last-task"><div class="header_1_class">Prerequisites</div><p>Please install the following 3rd party software that is needed to successfully install ORIGAM.
