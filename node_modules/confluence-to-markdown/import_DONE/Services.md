# Services

Internal and external services can be called by the sequential workflow engine's [Service Method Call Task](/t/Service-Method-Call-Task) in order to retrieve or save data, send e-mails, connect to external systems, etc.

Services are called by using Service Adapters. These are .NET libraries.

There is a number of service agents included but you can also create your own [custom Service Adapter](/t/Custom-Service-Adapters).
