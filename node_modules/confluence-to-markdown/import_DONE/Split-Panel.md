# Split Panel

**SplitPanel** allows you to place two screen sections (or other widgets) on the same screen.

1.  In the **User Interface Model** open the screen that you want to split or create a new one.
2.  In the **Toolbox** select **Widgets** and then **SplitPanel**. By double-click or drag-and-drop place the element on the **Design Surface**. Choose the size and position of the split panel on your screen.

3.  In the **Toolbox** \> **Screen Sections** select the screen sections and by drag-and-drop place them in the desired position.
4.  To set the **TabIndex** press **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**T** and by clicking on the screen sections select their order. The first one has the number 0.0, the second 0.1. Press **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**T** again.

5.  You can change the settings in the **Properties** view (keyboard shortcut **F4**). If you don't want the user to change the position of the split, set the **FixedSize** option to `True` (default is `False`). Here you can also select if you want to split the screen vertically or horizontally.
