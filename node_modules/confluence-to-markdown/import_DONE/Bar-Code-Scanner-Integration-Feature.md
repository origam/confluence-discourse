# Bar-Code Scanner Integration Feature

You can configure your application in a way that it can work with a keyboard emulating barcode scanner.

For that you can configure:

-   Keyboard prefix
-   Keyboard suffix

When the prefix is entered on the keyboard (invoked by the scanner) the application stops displaying keys on the screen and listens to the scanner until the suffix is delivered. After that the barcode scanned is sent to a configured **action button**. There the input can be processed to e.g. read the product data and add an item to your sales order.
