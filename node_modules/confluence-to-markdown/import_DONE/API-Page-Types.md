# API Page Types

ORIGAM can handle the following page types:

### [Data Page](/t/Data-Page)

Data page can be used to expose CRUD http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,\_read,\_update_and_delete data operations.

### [File Download Page](/t/File-Download-Page)

Using this element you can define an API using which you will be able to download binary objects (BLOB) from the database, e.g. record attachments.

### [Report Page](/t/Report-Page)

### [Workflow Page](/t/Workflow-Page)

Using Workflow API you can expose sequential workflow functionality through the API. You would use this API typically where simple Data Page would not provide enough functionality, e.g. when additional processing has to happen before storing the data into the database.
