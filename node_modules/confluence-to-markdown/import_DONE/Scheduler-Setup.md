| binPath         | Path to your ORIGAM application folder which includes OrigamScheduler.exe. |

# Configuration

It is possible to install several schedulers, each of which will process only a subset of schedules. This way you can scale to multiple servers (or server cores since the schedules are processed in a single thread).
