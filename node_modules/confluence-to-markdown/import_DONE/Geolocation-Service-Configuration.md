# Geolocation Service Configuration

This page describes steps to configure geo location service.

Geo location configuration is stored in external file, which is linked from web.config.

First there has to be config section added to the web.config file:

**Config section in web.config**

``` xml
<configSections>
    <section name="geoLocationSettings" type="System.Configuration.NameValueFileSectionHandler, System, Version=1.0.3300.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089"/>
</configSections>
<geoLocationSettings file="geoLocation.config"/>
```

Content of geo location service configuration file is following:

**geoLocation.config**

``` xml
<geoLocationSettings>
  <add key="serviceUrl" value="http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search"/>
</geoLocationSettings>
```

There is only on key in geo location settings -` serviceUrl`, which contains url to the geo location service system is supposed to use.
