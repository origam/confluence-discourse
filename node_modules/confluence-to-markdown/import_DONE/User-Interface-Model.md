# User Interface Model

User interface definition is an integral part of ORIGAM solution development. Building complex user interfaces on top of the [data model](/t/Data-Model) is fast and easy.To simplify complex data screen design, user interface development is split into two parts:

1.  Screen Sections
2.  Screens

This maps the following to the data model:

-   Screen sections are the visualization of [Data Entities](/t/Entities)

-   Screens are the visualization of [Data Structures](/t/Data-Structures).

The benefit of splitting the user interface design into sections and screens is clear mapping to the data model and also reusability, which allows you to use the same screen section in multiple screens.

# User Interface MODEL BASE ELEMENTS

### [Charts](/t/Charts)

You can easily implement chart visualization of data in your ORIGAM application. Any screen section can add a Chart View.

### [Dashboard Widgets](/t/Dashboard-Widgets)

Dashboards Widgets are predefined parts (e.g. charts, tables, values) that users can later add to their dashboards.

### [Images](/t/Images)

Here you can find a list of images that can be used as menu or action button icons.

### [Keyboard Shortcuts](/t/Keyboard-Shortcuts)

Here you can find a list of keyboard shortcut definitions that can be assigned to action buttons.

### [Menu](/t/Menu)

Users need a way to access the the different screens and workflows from the client application. To allow this, you must define a menu. The menu is a list of functions and sub-menus that will be displayed in the client application.

### [Notification Boxes And Tooltips](/t/Notification-Boxes-And-Tooltips)

Notification boxes allow you to dynamically display information in different parts of the application.

### [Reports](/t/Reports)

ORIGAM allows data analysts to view and analyze data from different data sources by using all the infrastructure of ORIGAM services and user interfaces.

### [Screens](/t/Screens)

A Screens is a collection of screen sections and other widgets built on a data structure definition.

### [Screen Sections](/t/Screen-Sections)

A Screen Section is a user interface element built on an entity [Entities](/t/Entities) definition.

### [Styles](/t/Styles)

### [Widgets](/t/Widgets)

This part describes different user interface controls that can be placed either on screens or on sections.

### [Hashtag Categories](/t/Hashtag-Categories)

Hashtags in ORIGAM are a way how to create links to data from unstructured HTML pages, chats, etc. Hashtag category is e.g. "customer". Hashtag label is customer/john_doe while hashtag itself is a specially crafted \<a\> tag that contains both the hashtag category and an identification of the target record.
