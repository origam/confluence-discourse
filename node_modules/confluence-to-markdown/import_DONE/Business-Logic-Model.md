# Business Logic Model

The Business logic model allows you to define the functional part of your application.

Although the user interface together with the data model themselves provide lots of built-in functionality you will also need to provide some

-   Validations
-   Data transformations
-   State workflows
-   etc.

# Business Logic MODEL BASE ELEMENTS

### [Rules](/t/Rules)

### [Schedules](/t/Schedules)

### [Schedule Times](/t/Schedule-Times)

### [Sequential Workflows](/t/Sequential-Workflows)

Workflows allow you to define a sequence of tasks which will make up the functionality of your solution. Workflows can be added to a menu in your user interface or they can be called by other workflows.

### [Services](/t/Services)

Internal and external services can be called by the sequential workflow engine's Service Method Call Task in order to retrieve or save data, send e-mails, connect to external systems, etc.

### [State Workflows](/t/State-Workflows)

### [Transformations](/t/Transformations)

Transformations are used in sequential workflows and other places where you need to modify data loaded from a database or transform them to a different format.

### [Work Queue Classes](/t/Work-Queue-Classes)

The Work Queue Class is a part of the model which defines how a work queue message looks (what fields it has), how it gets composed and what special operations (beyond some default ones) you can execute on it.
