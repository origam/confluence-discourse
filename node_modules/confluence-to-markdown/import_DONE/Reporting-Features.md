# Reporting Features

Reporting is integrated deep into every application. You can

-   Show page reports like invoices for a current record by clicking a button
-   Show list reports by showing a selection dialog first
-   Show web reports-by showing a selection dialog and then passing the parameters to an external URL

Reports from an integrated reporting engine are shown as a ready-to-save or print PDF.

Reports can be localized and are using built-in data-layer so they do not access the database directly, leveraging bulit-in data model, filters, etc.
