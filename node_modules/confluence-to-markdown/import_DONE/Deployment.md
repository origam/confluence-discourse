# Deployment

The Deployment model allows you to define the model versions and database upgrade scripts between those versions.

Deployment scripts will get executed when you deploy a new version to the customer.

You will typically use the [Deployment Script Generator](/t/Deployment-Script-Generator) for data model deployment scripts.
