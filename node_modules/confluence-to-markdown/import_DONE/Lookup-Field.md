| ExcludeFromAllFields | If set to `True`, the field will not be included in the list of fields in a Data Structure if "**AllFields**=`True`" is set in a Data Structure Entity. This is useful e.g. for database function calls that are expensive and used only for lookups that would otherwise slow down the system if loaded e.g. to forms. |
| Field                | The field by which the looked-up value will be loaded, in most cases the Id (in form of a foreign key) of the entity that contains the looked-up values.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Lookup               | The [lookup](/t/Lookups) to be used by the data service to look up a value by the provided **Field**.                                                                                                                                                                             |
