# Data Audit Log

Audit log records all create/update/delete events on the data.

Every log record contains the following information:

-   Who created the log record (Id from the Address Book)
-   Date/time when the event occurred
-   Original value
-   New value
-   Original Id value (if the affected field was a lookup field)
-   New Id value (if the affected field was a lookup field)
-   Type of audit event (Added/Deleted/Updated)

# HOw To ENable AUDITLOG

Auditing is disabled for all the entities by default. It has to be turned on on an entity (DataEntity) level - by setting 'IsAuditingEnabled' property to 'True'.

You can exclude certain fields from being audited - by setting 'ExcludeFromAuditing' property in a field (DataEntityColumn).

You don't have to set anything else. Just restart the server.
