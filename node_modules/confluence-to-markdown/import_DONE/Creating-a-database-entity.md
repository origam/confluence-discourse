# Creating a database entity

An [entity](/t/Entities) is the most basic part of the [Data Model](/t/Data-Model). A database entity maps to a database and represents one database table. Every [field](/t/Fields) represents one column in the table. This tutorial will show you how to create a database entity.

1.  Expand the **Data** folder in the **Model Browser**. Under **Entities** find the folder named after your project. Right-click on the folder and select **New** \> **Database Entity**.

2.  A model editor will open where you can edit the entity attributes. Several attributes have default settings (you can learn more about them [here](/t/Entities)), but there are some for you to fill in. The first is the **Name** of the entity that will be used in all references to this entity. The second is the **Caption** that will show in the web application. Fill in the desired fields and click on **Save** on the toolbar (or press Ctrl+S).

    Note that there is a star in front of the name of the entity in the tab heading. That means that you have made changes that aren't saved yet.

3.  When you save a new entity (and every time you open an existing entity), a menu will appear on the toolbar. You can reach this menu also by a right-click on the entity in the Model Browser. Here you can see all possible operations you can do concerning the entity. Also note that you have automatically inherited several fields from the **IOrigamEntity2**, the most notable being the **Id** field with the globally unique identifier (GUID). You can find them in the subfolder **\_Ancestors**.
