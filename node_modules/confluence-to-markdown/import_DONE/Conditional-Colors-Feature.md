# Conditional Colors Feature

You can easily define row colors either by specifying a conditional expression (e.g. color will be red if DueDate \< CurrentDate) or by setting a color depending on a value selected in a field (e.g. take a color by a Status and let the users pick their own colors in the status definition).

The colors are automatically displayed in

-   Detail view
-   Table view
-   Calendar view

# Example

Foreground color depending on a due date (red = due), background color depending on a task type (color is picked in a task type definition).
