# IMAP Loader

IMAP loader allows you to automatically pick-up e-mails from a IMAP enabled mail server. It supports SSL. E-mails are moved to a configurable archive folder after being picked-up.

# WORK QUEUE CLASS

This loader uses Mail work queue class.

# CONFIGURE IMAP LOADER

In order to pick-up e-mails to your Work Queue from an IMAP account, you have to fill the **External Source** field with `IMAP` on tab Creation and fill Connection String as described later. All other fields of External Source group are not applicable and should remain empty.

# CONFIGURE CONNECTION STRING

The connection string can consist from the following parts:

|            |                                                                                                                                                                |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| url        | Url of the IMAP server (e.g. imap.mycompany.com)                                                                                                               |
| port       | IMAP server's port number (typically 143 or 993 for SSL encrypted)                                                                                             |
| ssl        | If `True` then the connection will be encrypted (you would probably need to change also the port number).                                                      |
| mailbox    | Name of the folder with the incoming e-mails (default is `INBOX`)                                                                                              |
| dropbox    | Name of the archive folder (where e-mail will be moved after being picked-up)                                                                                  |
| attachHtml | If `True` then the HTML version of the e-mail (if available) will be attached as an attachment to the work queue entry together with other e-mail attachments. |
| badmail    | Name of a folder where e-mails that had problems with loading will be moved to.                                                                                |
