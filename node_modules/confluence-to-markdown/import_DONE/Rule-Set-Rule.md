|                  |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ConditionRule    | Select a [Condition Rule](/t/Condition-Rule) that will act as a start rule for the Data Structure Rule. The Data Structure Rule will be applied only if this condition is fulfilled. |
| Entity           | The entity on which the rule operates.                                                                                                                                               |
| Priority         | By choosing a priority of the rule, you define the sequence in which the rules in a rule set will be executed.                                                                       |
| RuleDependencies | You can select and edit the fields the rule is dependent on.                                                                                                                         |
| TargetField      | Which field will be computed using the rule.                                                                                                                                         |
| ValueRule        | Choose a [Simple Data Rule](/t/Simple-Data-Rule) that will compute the value of the selected field.                                                                                  |

Note: When using both the ConditionRule and the ValueRule, the value of **IsPathRelative** must be set the same for both rules.
