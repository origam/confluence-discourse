# Web Services (SOAP) API

The WebService API is a low-level programming interface used to directly access data objects and sequential workflows in your ORIGAM application.

Your application developer might provide special RESTful methods for your applications. Use web services only if you cannot achieve the desired functionality by an API provided to you by your developer.

# Communication Protocol

All ORIGAM Web API services are available using a standard WebService communication protocol (i.e. TCP/IP, HTTP, SOAP stack).

# Security

Service access is secured by

-   Authentization and
-   Authorization

# Authentization

Authentization depends on the configuration of your IIS server. It can be configured to Anonymous, Standard Authentication or Windows Authentication.

# Authorization

All calls to web service methods automatically take over the authorization settings of your [ORIGAM Runtime](/t/ORIGAM-Runtime) installation. The authenticated user has only access to those methods and objects assigned in his role list.
