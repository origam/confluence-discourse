# Data Model

The Data Model is the base level of the modeling process. It is the foundation of the resulting application. After the Data Model is defined, all the following modeling makes use of it. For example, when designing screens, the editor offers a list of data fields that you can just drag and drop into the form designer.

# Data Model Base Elements

### [Data Constants](/t/Data-Constants)

Data constants allow you to store different constant values that will be used elsewhere in the system. With data constants you can also define parameters for your application.

### [Data Structures](/t/Data-Structures)

Data structures can be also described as entity-sets. While entities describe a single dimension (entity/fields), data structures allow definition of a hierarchical schema.

### [Data Types](/t/Data-Types)

Data types are the most basic elements in the model. They represent the minimal data storage containers.

### [Entities](/t/Entities)

The Entity model is the most basic part of the model. It defines data entities which in turn define database tables for storing customer data. Entities contain not only fields but also predefined filters, row-level-security rules, row-color rules and more.

### [Functions](/t/Functions)

Functions define a set of functions you can use for modeling data filters or simple calculated entity fields. You can add your own database functions (that you create manually in the database and map using this part of the model).

### [Lookups](/t/Lookups)

Lookups define the way how to fill-in Drop-Down lists and how to translate id's to names both in the user interface and business logic.

### [Tree Structures](/t/Tree-Structures)

Here you can define hierarchical structures that you can later use in the user interface.
