# Debugging Sequential Workflows

The ORIGAM workflow engine currently supports debugging by tracing. That means the developer can record the full log of "what happened" during the workflow's execution.

This brings a big advantage: Workflows can be debugged ex-post, even in the production environment. If the developer cannot reproduce a problem, tracing can be turned on in the production environment and after the problem is reproduced by the end user, the developer can look at the log and identify the source of the problem.

Debugging occurs in 5 steps:

1.  Set TraceLevel in the workflow or one of its tasks
2.  Execute the workflow
3.  Review the trace log by executing the Tools \> Show Trace in ORIGAM Architect
4.  Fix any bugs
5.  Set TraceLevel to None, so there is no performance bottleneck.

If you are not debugging, set all steps to **TraceLevel = None**. Having tracing turned on has a negative impact on performance. Firstly, a huge amount of data overhead is processed during workflow execution, thus slowing it down, secondly the trace log increases the database size.
