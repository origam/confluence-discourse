# External Work Queue Loaders

External loader can fill a [work queue](/t/Work-Queues) with messages based on an external data source, e.g. by loading e-mails, files or data from web services.

# PREREQUISITES

Make sure these parameters are set in your AsapSettings.config file:

``` html/xml
<LoadExternalWorkQueues>true</LoadExternalWorkQueues>
<ExternalWorkQueueCheckPeriod>180</ExternalWorkQueueCheckPeriod>
```

Set up the ExternalWorkQueueCheckPeriod to any number of seconds you want the files being checked.

# Built-In External Loaders

Some of the loaders are built-in. You can create your own by using a universal [Workflow Loader](/t/Workflow-Loader).

### [File Loader](/t/File-Loader)

File loader allows you to watch a specific file system folder for files and pick them up to a work queue where they can be processed.

### [IATA BSP File Loader](/t/IATA-BSP-File-Loader)

IATA BSP file loader allows you to watch a specific file system folder for IATA BSP files, split them into the segments and store those segment into a work queue where they can be processed. Loader keeps information on processed files in separate index file, so it can be run on folder without need to delete its content.

### [IMAP Loader](/t/IMAP-Loader)

IMAP loader allows you to automatically pick-up e-mails from a IMAP enabled mail server.

### [Indexed File Loader](/t/Indexed-File-Loader)

Indexed file loader allows you to watch a specific file system folder for files and pick them up to a work queue where they can be processed. Processed files are hashed and indexed and are processed again only if their contents was changed.

### [POP3 Loader](/t/POP3-Loader)

POP3 loader allows you to automatically pick-up e-mails from a POP3 enabled mail server.

### [WebSphere MQ Loader](/t/WebSphere-MQ-Loader)

WebSphere MQ loader allows you to consume messages from WebSphere MQ and pass them to work queue for processing.

### [Workflow Loader](/t/Workflow-Loader)

Workflow loader allows you to define your own data source for work queue messages using a Sequential Workflow.
