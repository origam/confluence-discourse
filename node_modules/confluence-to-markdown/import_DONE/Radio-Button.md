# Radio Button

The Radio Button makes it possible to select from different values into a field. Each option has a constant defined. By selecting an option the value is inserted into a specific field.

# Usage

In order to create a set of radio buttons you need to have a single field on which you will bind all the radio buttons in the same group.

Then you set the **ValueConstant** on each of the radio buttons to a different constant. When radio button is selected that specific value will be set to the data field.

# Example

In the following case there are 2 buttons where **Checked** is bound to `IsNewTemplate` field. One set to constant `_true` and the other set to `_false`. Then row-level-security rules are applied based on that value.
