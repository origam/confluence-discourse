# Tab Control

**TabControl** allows you to separate screen sections into different tabs in order to make the user interface more intuitive for the user.

1.  In the **User Interface Model** open the screen that you want to work with or create a new one.
2.  In the **Toolbox** select **Widgets** and then **TabControl**. By double-click or drag-and-drop place the element on the **Design Surface** and enlarge it for better manipulation**.**

3.  Click on the heading of one **TabPage** (the active one has blue backgroung). In the **Toolbox** \> **Screen Sections** select one screen section and by double-click or drag-and-drop place it on the **Design Surface**. Repeat for the other **TabPage**.

4.  The **TabControl** widget opens with two tab pages. If you need more, go to the **Properties** view (keyboard shortcut **F4**) and in the drop-down list select **AsTabControl1**. This is an overview of settings for the whole widget and here you can add or remove tabs.

6.  Check that all entities that are a base for the screen sections used in the tabs are in the data structure of the entity used as a data source of the screen. Also check in the **Properties** that the **DataMember** field is correctly filled (points to the correct entity).
