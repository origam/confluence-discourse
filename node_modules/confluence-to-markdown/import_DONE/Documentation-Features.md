# Documentation Features

# Fully Automated Documentation

Save time writing hundreds of pages of product technical documentation never getting it synchronized with the latest version.

ORIGAM's documentation provides an interactive always up-to-date documentation of the working system.

# Customer Specific

For the first time you can have a single document containing both standard and customer specific functionaity. In case you have a standard product which you customize for every customer (e.g. add custom fields, menu items, business logic) the documentation will blend all the features into a unified document.

# Screen to Data

Browse the application's menu and see how fields are connected to the database. This will help you debugging data and when creating custom database queries.

Screen documentation can be also given to end users to see complete screen information. Each screen can additionally contain a free formatted text with screen description.
