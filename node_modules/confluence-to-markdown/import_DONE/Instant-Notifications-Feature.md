# Instant Notifications Feature

Notification box is part of the main user interface. It makes it possible to display any notification data without a user action.

Possible uses:

-   Displaying company status (e.g. current fiscal year)
-   Displaying user status (e.g. current project)
-   Displaying incoming phone call (see picture)

The notification box can automatically refresh in a defined interval.

# Example

Displaying user status-current phone line:

Displaying user status-time worked on a current activity. Refreshes every second, effectively turning to be stop-watch:
