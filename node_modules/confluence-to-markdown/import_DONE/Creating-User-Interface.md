# Creating User Interface

The [User Interface Model](/t/User-Interface-Model) is an important part of ORIGAM Architect that builds atop the [Data Model](/t/Data-Model). In this tutorial you will learn how to create a [Screen Section](/t/Screen-Sections), a [Screen](/t/Screens) and a [Menu](/t/Menu).

### Screen Section

A [Screen Section](/t/Screen-Sections) is a UI element that displays data from the [entity](/t/Entities) on which it is based. It can display all or only several [fields](/t/Fields) (i.e. rows of data) from the entity. You can also create more screen sections based on one entity with different choise of fields.

1.  In the Model Browser go to the **Data Model** \> **Entities** \> **YourProjectName** and select an entity. Right-click on the entity and select **Actions** \> **Create Screen Section**.  
      
    ![12124291_425x374](upload://zcU5dfwlH6esiKdoGftGOMOr6LF.png)  
      
2.  In the opened dialog window you have a checklist with all fields in the entity. Select those you want to show on the screen section and click on **OK**.  
      
    ![12124292_230x300](upload://ctBX8XAZ44SxDXFqQO0spM6aUqP.png)  
      
3.  In the model editor you can see the layout of the screen section. In the Invoice tab in the Toolbox on the left side are all fields from the entity. The [Widgets](/t/Screen-Section-Widgets) tab offers different ways how you can present your data. You can add items from both tabs by drag-and-drop and remove them by clicking on the field and pressing the **Delete** key.

4.  A very important feature is the **Properties** view. You can select it in the **Menu** under **View** \> **Properties** or by pressing **F4** and it will appear in the docked window. Here you can set e.g. the position of the elements and the captions, the ReadOnly attribute or the [view](/t/Views) in case of the whole section.  
      
    ![12124296_274x500](upload://8KmRE1yNJ6CtRgaMZ8RVhhGNF6n.png)  
      
5.  You can move the elements around and change their position by drag-and-drop. Blue lines will appear that will help you keep the same horizontal position of and space between the elements. You can resize the element by moving the mouse on the left or right edge of the element until a double-headed arrow appears, click and drag the mouse to make the element larger or smaller. If you want to make the element horizontally bigger, you must first go to **Properties** (press **F4**) and set the value **Multiline** to `True`. If your caption is too long and does not show correctly, in **Properties** increase the **CaptionLength**. There, you can also set the **ReadOnly** value to `True`, so that the user can't change the values. The element will then change color from white to light gray.  
      
    ![12124295_600x300](upload://7OlCVs8Mq5f1SNwbXpJUSMrej4q.png)  
      
6.  When you are satisfied with the look of the screen section, one more step remains before you save the changes. You have to set the **TabIndex**. The TabIndex is a sequence in which the user will move between the elements by pressing the **Tab** key. You can either set it manually for each element in **Properties**, or in the editor click on the screen section and press **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**T**. White numbers with a blue background will appear in the top left corner of each element. Click on the elements in the desired order (the already selected elements will change to a blue number with a white background) and again press **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**T**.  
      
    ![12124303_607x306](upload://rGwaPmM773evwaf5G5ACzeB1NC6.png)  
      
7.  After you finish editing, save the changes.

### Screen

A [Screen](/t/Screens) is a UI element that is built on a [data structure](/t/Data-Structures) definition and is assembled from [screen sections](/t/Screen-Sections). It can consist of only one screen section or it can be a collection of several screen sections arranged by available [widgets](/t/Screen-Widgets) such as [Tab Control](/t/Tab-Control) or [Split Panel](/t/Split-Panel).

1.  There are several ways how you can create a screen. You can expand **Data Model** \> **Entities** \> **YourProjectName**, right-click on one entity and select **Actions** \> **Create Screen**. Another way is to expand **User Interface Model** \> **Screen Sections** \> **YourProjectName**, right-click on one screen section and select **Actions** \> **Create Screen**. Finally in the **User Interface Model** you can expand **Screens**, right-click on the subfolder named after your project and select **New** \> **Screen**.  
      
    ![12124318_435x442](upload://fN2dtyjfPMbkbtZTdK471fnhJXZ.png)  
      

2.  The model editor will open. If you created the screen using the first two ways, it will be based on the chosen entity. Using the last option, you have to select the **Data Source** for your screen. The **Name** will automatically change to that of your data source, but you can change it.  
      
    ![12124319_690x464](upload://jLq7OMJP3VkU3ZXy3vdS9ZgX6aw.png)  
      

3.  In the **Toolbox** on the **Screen Sections** tab select the screen section. When you click on one, it will appear in the **Design Surface**.

      
    ![12124320_690x464](upload://rZNddys1Q0IPisvtQc8mqP5lyJq.png)

4.  Again similar to the screen section you can change several attributes in the **Properties** (keyboard shortcut **F4**) view. Here you can set the **PanelTitle** that will show in the screen section heading, if you want to show the delete and new buttons or completely hide the navigation panel. If your screen section contains dates, you can also set the [**Calendar View**](/t/Calendar-View).  
      
    ![12124328_306x500](upload://5wmVyRBF523qgc1McTPnN5ZDayZ.png)  
      

5.  The screen can consist of one screen section. It is also possible to show more screen sections on one screen. For this you can use e.g. the [**SplitPanel**](/t/Split-Panel) widget. In this way you can either horizontally or vertically split the page in two parts. Likewise you can add another SplitPanel on the design surface and create a screen consisting of three parts. A detailed description how to create a split screen is [here](/t/Split-Panel).  
      
    ![12124323_538x413](upload://8JLdQUNsuPUor3AW5R02LegZvoH.png)  
      

    There is one very important thing you need to remember when showing more screen sections on one screen. You have to add the additional entites (on which the screen sections are based) to the **Data Structure** of the master entity (the entity selected as the **Data Source** for this screen). In the **Properties** you have to select the correct entity in the **DataMember** field.

6.  Another useful widget is **[TabControl](/t/Tab-Control)**. It enables you to access more screen sections on one screen. A detailed description how to create TabControl is [here](/t/Tab-Control).  
      
    ![12124326_539x412](upload://bb7nBwQP4GocS2bYuEhpxinDzka.png)

### Menu

A [Menu](/t/Menu) is a UI element that gives you access to a screen or a workflow.

1.  The easiest way to create a Menu Item is when you have already created a screen section and a screen.You can expand the **User Interface Model** \> **Menu**, right-click on the **Menu** folder (with the house icon) and select **New** \> **Screen Reference**.  
      

    ![12124663_429x281](upload://j089XKlMtX1e0V5ZWCDBH5Jesf3.png)

2.  The model editor will open. Now you can fill in the attributes. The element is referenced in the model by **Name**. **DisplayName** is used in the web application and this is what will the user see. In **Screen** you set a reference to the screen that will be displayed when you click on the menu item. In **Roles** you grant access to the screen to a user. When you use a star (\*), the screen will be visible for all users. Otherwise fill in a list of application roles separated by a semicolon.

      
    ![12124667_336x500](upload://fYw9laWxuZjqvwU67u9VWnNVZIK.png)

3.  There are other ways to create a Menu Item. You can expand **Data Model** \> **Entities** \> **YourProjectName**, right-click on one entity and select **Actions** \> **Create Menu Item**. A wizard will appear that will create a screen section, a screen, a menu item and a data structure for you. Another way is to expand **User Interface Model** \> **Screen Sections** \> **YourProjectName**, right-click on one screen section and select **Actions** \> **Create Menu Item**. Finally in the **User Interface Model** you can expand **Screens** \> **YourProjectName**, right-click on one screen and select **Actions** \> **Create Menu Item**.

    ![12124664_373x457](upload://ecrHJxJCsq8TSbjrEBZIYzFXDl7.png)

4.  A wizard will appear where you fill the **Caption** and **Role** fields. Click on OK.  
      
    ![12124665_239x101](upload://6ZdKF304vqCqjfAv9Rua0eZQco4.png)  
      

5.  The wizard will finish for you and show you the generated element.
