# User Interface Designer

Use the designer to place the widgets on screens or screen sections. The designer is divided into the following sections:

|                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Screen/Section Properties | Specify name and which [data structure](/t/Data-Structures) (in case of the [Screen](/t/Screens)) or [data entity](/t/Entities) (in case of the [Screen Section](/t/Screen-Sections)) will be used as a base for the designer. |
| Toolbox                   | Lists all the objects you can place on the screen/section. When designing screen sections, you can directly place the data entity fields on the workbench and corresponding [widgets](/t/Widgets) will be created.             |
| Property Grid (F4)        | In this grid you can set and modify any properties of the widgets so their behaviour is changed from default.                                                                                                                  |
| Designer                  | The workbench on which you place controls.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Tip

By pressing **Ctrl+Shift+T** in the designer you can quickly set tab indexes (order in which the user can move from widget to widget by pressing Tab key on the keyboard). Click on each control in the order in which you want the tab indexes to be set.
