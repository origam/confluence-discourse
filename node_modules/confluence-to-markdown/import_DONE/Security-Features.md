# Security Features

It is easy to define security of an ORIGAM application. Security is deeply integrated on different levels:

-   Three level security model (users/roles/permissions)
-   Data change auditing
-   Row-level-security (rules for setting view/edit/delete permissions on data rows)
-   Menu permissions (assigning which menus each user can access)
-   API permissions (assigning which API methods each user can access)
-   SSL support

Once you define your permissions they automatically work everywhere. E.g. when you define row-level-security so the user can only see records of her organization only those records appear in any screen, drop-down field or through an API call.

The same works with data auditing - no matter through which functionality you change the data (a screen, sequential workflow, API call) - the changes in the data will always get audited.
