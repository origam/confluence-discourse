# Implicit Filter

This property allows you to set a filter on the section data that will always be applied.

# Example 1

You need a split-screen with 2 sections. The top section will filter only "assigned" tasks, i.e. those that have a Person assigned. The bottom section will only list those tasks that are "unassigned".

The screen should basically be set-up on a single entity but the sections will only view some of the records.

This filter tests if both `DateStart` and refFleetVehicleId are `NULL`.

``` xml
<FilterPart Property="DateStart" Operator="15"/>
<FilterPart Property="refFleetVehicleId" Operator="15"/>
```

# EXAMPLE 2

There is a complex screen with several tabs. There are two tabs based on the same data set, one is supposed to show all rows and the other one should show only data from certain group identified by given GUID.

``` xml
<FilterPart Property="refGroupId" Operator="1" RightSideValue="ac4ae4f9-0162-4f3f-c81c-daa2fd2da602"/>
```

# Syntax

This property uses an XML that will specifies the filter.

**FilterPart**

You can apply multiple filters, each in its own `FilterPart` section. If there are more all we be applied (AND).
