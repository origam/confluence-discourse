# Email Address Confirmation

ORIGAM has an email confirmation feature. If enabled, a page `ConfirmEmail` serves as a validation point for tokens. Two parameters are expected: `userId` and `token`. If a token is correct, the email address of user is set as confirmed.

For feature configuration see [Startup.cs User Management Configuration](/t/Startup-cs-User-Management-Configuration).
