# Data Views Feature

Screen section is a central part of displaying and navigating through the data. It is the most complex part of the user interface. It allows you to:

-   Navigate through multiple records
-   Add/Delete/Duplicate records
-   Show attachments
-   Show data audit log

By defining a single section you easily get multiple views on the data:

-   [Table View](/t/Table-View-Feature)
-   [Detail View](/t/Detail-View-Feature)
-   [Calendar View](/t/Calendar-View-Feature)
-   [Map View](/t/Map-View-Feature)
-   [Kanban View Feature](/t/Kanban-View-Feature)
-   [Chart View](/t/Chart-View-Feature)
