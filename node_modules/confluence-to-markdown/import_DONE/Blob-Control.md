# Blob Control

A Blob Control widget can be used to:

-   Upload files to the server
-   Download files to the local computer
-   Preview files (opening them directly)

It can also populate some file metadata:

-   File Name
-   Original Path
-   File Size
-   Date Created
-   Date Last Modified
-   Author
-   Remark
-   Thumbnail

The uploader can optionally compress the files using a ZIP compression.

# Example

A Blob Control that uploads/downloads images to the database. Below the blob control there is an [Image Box](/t/Image-Box) widget which shows the thumbnail of the uploaded picture.
