# Tasks

The workflow is a sequence of steps, executed by the workflow engine. The sequence of the workflow is made of tasks or [blocks](/t/Blocks). Tasks can use the data stored in [context stores](/t/Context-Store) defined for this workflow.

# Output Methods

<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<th class="confluenceTh">Ignore</th>
<td class="confluenceTd">Any output data will be ignored and no context will be updated when the task finishes.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<th class="confluenceTh">AppendMergeExisting</th>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>Any updates to the existing data will be updated using the entity primary key. Any new data (not found in the original context by the primary key) will be appended to the context. No data will be deleted from the context.</p>
<p>This method is the default for the <a href="/t/Service-Method-Call-Task">Service Method Call</a> task, because e.g. the data transformation will typically return subset of the XML data, so they can be updated in the context. If FullMerge is used, all missing data would get deleted.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<th class="confluenceTh">FullMerge</th>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>The context will get updated, so that it will contain only the data returned by the finished task. The data found by using the primary key will get updated, the data not found by the primary key will get inserted and the data which exist in the context but do not exist in the data returned by the task will get deleted from the context.</p>
<p>This method is the default for the <a href="/t/User-Interface-Task">User Interface</a> task, because users are allowed to do any updates to the data, including deletions. It is intended that the context shows exactly the same data after editing that the user saw on the screen, therefore a full comparison and merge must be performed between the data returned from the task and the context.</p></td>
