# Filter Sets

Defines a set of predefined [entity filters](/t/Filters) that can be selected when loading data from a [DataService](/t/DataService).

When more than 1 filter is defined in the filter set, all the search criteria must be satisfied, before the correct record is loaded (i.e. there is `AND` between the filters).

# Child Elements

-   [Filter Set Filter](/t/Filter-Set-Filter) - Maps an [entity filter](http://update.simplicor.com/architect-doc/ch04s03.html#entity_filter) to a filter set.

# Example

Let's say you have a data structure called Invoice. By loading this data structure without a filter, you would get all the invoices ever entered to the system. So at least you will need a filter, which will load just one invoice, by its Id. So you will create a filter set GetById.

Then your application has an approval workflow for the invoices. So you create another filter set `GetByInvoiceState`. This filter set will contain a filter, which will load invoices by their state. This filter can additionally contain a parameter, so when loading the data, you will have to provide an Id of the requested invoice state.
