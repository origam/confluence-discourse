# Rule Set Reference

**Rule Set Reference** is used when you want to refer to another already created [Rule Set](/t/Rule-Sets). That is practical e.g. for [Context Stores](/t/Context-Store) in [Sequential Workflows](/t/Sequential-Workflows), because you don't have to create the rule sets again, you can just combine the existing ones as needed.
