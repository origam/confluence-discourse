# DataService

Data Service is the most important service because it connects to database engines. It is also the most sophisticated service.Data Service uses the complete ORIGAM [data model](/t/Data-Model) metadata in order to translate it to internal language of each database server, typically to SQL.But you will never need to write an SQL yourself anywhere in the model, all the statements are generated dynamically.

Data Service can be configured to connect to different database engines like SQL Server or Oracle.
