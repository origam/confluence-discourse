# Data Warehouse Features

ORIGAM contains some advanced features that let you enhance your applications with data warehouse capabilities or to build complete data warehouses.

These features include:

-   [ETL](#DataWarehouseFeatures-ETL)
-   [Data Deduplication](#DataWarehouseFeatures-DataDeduplication)
-   [Data Visualization](#DataWarehouseFeatures-DataVisualization)
-   [Security](#DataWarehouseFeatures-Security)
-   [Data Sharing](#DataWarehouseFeatures-DataSharing)

# ETL

-   Connecting to different data sources/APIs to retrieve data
-   Data transformations using XSLT or custom .NET functions
-   Integrated Insert/Update (UPSERT) including incrementing/decrementing udpated data
-   Scheduled actions

# Data Deduplication

It is very easy to deduplicate data either using a custom algorithm or by user selection. The data-deduplication function will then merge 2 records into one while upgrading all dependencies throughout the whole database in a single step. It also automatically integrates with data-auditing so deduplicated child records are marked as such.

# Data Visualization

You can use any of the user [interface features](/t/User-Interface-Features) to show data to the users either for manual data editing/cleaning or for analyzing using e.g. [table views, Excel exports](/t/Table-View-Feature), [charts](/t/Chart-View-Feature).

# Security

Data can be secured using multiple [security features](/t/Security-Features) so users can only access allowed data. Any data changes can be automatically audited as well.

# Data Sharing

Data can be finally shared either using the built-in user interface or by providing API's.
