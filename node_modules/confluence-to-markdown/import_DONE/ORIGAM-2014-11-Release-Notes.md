# Migration

This version has some migration requirements. **PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.**

## **Architect Config changes**

We updated the way how **Output** window works in Architect. Before a selected number of events were logged there. From this version it is possible to configure which events will be visible and the number of events was greatly increased.

In fact anything that is being logged using the internal log4net library can be also displayed in the Output window.

The basic set of events can be configured by adding the following part to your AsapArchitect.exe.config:

``` xml
    <log4net>
        <!-- ConsoleAppender will send the logs to the Output pad -->
        <appender name="ConsoleAppender" type="log4net.Appender.ConsoleAppender">
            <layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout">
                <conversionPattern value="%-5level %logger - %message%newline" />
            </layout>
        </appender>
        <appender name="WorkflowConsoleAppender" type="log4net.Appender.ConsoleAppender">
            <layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout">
                <conversionPattern value="%message%newline" />
            </layout>
        </appender>
        <appender name="RuleConsoleAppender" type="log4net.Appender.ConsoleAppender">
            <layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout">
                <conversionPattern value="Rule: %message%newline" />
            </layout>
        </appender>
        <root>
            <level value="INFO" />
            <appender-ref ref="ConsoleAppender" />
        </root>
        <logger name="CZ.Advantages.Asap.Workbench.Services" additivity="false">
            <level value="DEBUG" />
            <appender-ref ref="WorkflowConsoleAppender" />
        </logger>
        <logger name="CZ.Advantages.Asap.Workflow" additivity="false">
            <level value="DEBUG" />
            <appender-ref ref="WorkflowConsoleAppender" />
        </logger>
        <logger name="CZ.Advantages.Asap.Rule" additivity="false">
            <level value="DEBUG" />
            <appender-ref ref="RuleConsoleAppender" />
        </logger>
    </log4net>
```

If you do not have log4net configured at all you need more entries in the config file. See [Config File](/t/Config-File) for a sample.

## **APPLICATION SERVER files**

Just download the release ZIP file and replace all server files with the new version. You do not have to delete any files, just replace the existing ones.

## **Application Server Web.config changes**

While preparing for future functionality we had to change naming of some internal classes that have influence on the web.config. We took this opportunity and rebranded them, too.

In order to get ORIGAM backend working you need to do the following changes in the web.config file:

1.  Replace all **cz.advantages.asap.services** with **Origam.Server**

2.  Replace **pages.AsapPagesModule** with **Pages.PagesModule**

3.  Replace **doc.DocHandler** with Doc.DocHandler

4.  Replace **search.SearchResultHandler** with **Search.SearchResultHandler** (if you find such an entry)

5.  Replace **cz.advantages.asap.services.AttachmentSQLDbHandler** with **Origam.Server.AttachmentSQLDbHandler** (if you find such an entry)

## Model Changes

We also made some important changes in the AsapRoot package.

1.  **First update Architect to the newest version.**
2.  Download the actual root packages from [Downloads](https://origam.com/download/index)
3.  Run Architect
4.  Confirm the version change
5.  Open AsapRoot package
6.  Select **File \> Import Single Package** and select the newly downloaded AsapRoot package.
7.  Save the model.
8.  Reload the Root package (from the Packages tab) and select **File \> Run Update Scripts**
