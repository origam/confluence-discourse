# Redirect Action

Redirect defines where the HTTP request will be redirected after [Workflow Page](/t/Workflow-Page) has finished.If there are multiple Redirect elements specified they are all evaluated for conditions (rules, roles, features) in a specified sort order and the first matching is evaluated and redirected to the URL returned by the **XPath** attribute.

# Without Redirect

If no redirect is defined the result of calling the workflow is a redirection to the original caller's URL. This default behavior supports the following use case:

-   There is an HTML page displaying some data with a `<form>` element that updates the data.
-   The form posts data to a Workflow Page API which finally saves the data to the database.
-   After posting the form the user is redirected back to the original page which loads fresh data from a database.

|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SortOrder     | Order in which multiple redirect elements will be evaluated for matching conditions.                                                                                                             |
| Roles         | Enter an application role name for controlling which users have access to this redirect. Enter a star (`*`) if roles do not matter.                                                              |
| Features      | Enter a [feature](/t/Features) name which needs to be turned on in order to evaluate the condition true. If nothing is entered features do not matter. |
| ConditionRule | An XPath expression that will be executed upon the workflow's result and if it returns **True** then the redirect can happen.                                                                    |
| IsUrlEscaped  | Specifies if the returned URL has already been escaped. If **False** the URL will be escaped by the system before redirecting.                                                                   |
| XPath         | An expression that will return the URL to which the request will be redirected. The context is the workflow's result.                                                                            |
