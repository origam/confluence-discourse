# Configuration

If you have created some API, you have to add OrigamPagesModule into your web.config.

``` xml
<system.webServer>
    <modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="true" >
      ...
      <add name="OrigamPagesModule" type="Origam.Server.Pages.PagesModule, Origam.Server" />
    </modules>
</system.webServer>
```

If you plan to use PUT/DELETE functionality for your API, you have to set `runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests=true` (see above), because PUT and DELETE HTTP requests are not considered by IIS as managed and therefore a request is not processed by .NET (managed) pipepline. Otherwise it wouldn't e.g. call form authentication for such a request.

Furthermore, you have to disable WebDav module, because it handles PUTs and DELETEs sooner (If WebDav is configured).

``` xml
<system.webServer>
         <modules>
            <remove name="WebDAVModule" />
        </modules>
        <handlers>
            <remove name="WebDAV" />
        </handlers>
  </system.webServer>
```
