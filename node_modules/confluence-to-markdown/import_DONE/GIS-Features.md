# GIS Features

You can easily add GIS functionality to your applications by including a Map View on your data.

You can configure your own custom map layers by connecting to different services. Supported protocols:

-   OpenStreetMaps
-   WMS

You can draw different types of objects on your maps:

-   **Points** - Can have custom images
-   **Lines** - Can have custom colors and a description
-   **Polygons** - Can have custom colors and a description

Objects you draw can be later displayed on a [Map View](/t/Map-View-Feature) on any screen.
