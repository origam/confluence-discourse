# Model Elements

This chapter describes the basic building blocks of the ORIGAM - model elements.

All model elements have the following attributes:

|                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Attribute      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Id             | GUID of an element. Model elements will reference another element by its Id. There are exceptions, such as where model elements are referenced by name.                                                                                                                                     |
| Name           | The name of the element understandable to the developer. Sometimes the name is used as a reference, e.g. in [Transformations](/t/Transformations), where referencing by Id would make the code unclear.                                                                                     |
| Group          | Folder under which the element can be found in the Model Explorer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Package        | Shows under which package the element is stored. See Packages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| IsAbstract     | Indicates, if this element can be used as an ancestor of another element. For example, when you want to create a base data entity and derive the table structure in order to create enhanced data entities, you mark the Base data entity as IsAbstract. See [Inheritance](/t/Inheritance). |
| Ancestors      | Contains a list of elements that the current element inherits from. See Inheritance.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ItemType       | Shows element type. Used for developers of core model functionality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| SchemaItemType | Shows element type. Used for developers of core model functionality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
