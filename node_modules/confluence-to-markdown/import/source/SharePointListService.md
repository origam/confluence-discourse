# SharePointListService

Using this service you can communicate with Microsoft SharePoint Server 2003. Methods are available for reading and updating SharePoint lists.

SharePoint Service partly uses ORIGAM data model's metadata in order to map the SharePoint's list columns to ORIGAM data entities. If you want to access SharePoint lists data, you need to create data entities with exactly same structure as SharePoint lists. Names and types must be equal. Then create data structures using these entities. These data sturctures can then be used in communication with SharePoint.
