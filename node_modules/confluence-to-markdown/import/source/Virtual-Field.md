# Virtual Field

This field type is not mapped to any physical database field.

# Attributes.

Virtual fields have no extra attributes.

# Example

You need to create a [checkbox](/t/Check-Box) field for the user in order to select a record using a sequential workflow. But you don't want to save the value of the checkbox into the database. You would like to direct a workflow depending on the selection.

For this reason you would create a boolean virtual field **Selected**, which would be present in the data structure, but it would no persist to a database.
