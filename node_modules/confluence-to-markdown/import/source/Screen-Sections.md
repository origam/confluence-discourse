# Screen Sections

A Screen Section is a user interface element built on an [entity](/t/Entities) definition. This means that a screen section can display whole rows of data from the entity on which it is based. Screen sections are later always linked within [Screens](/t/Screens).

A Screen section is a definition of a part of the user interface. When used in a [screen](/t/Screens), the screen section definition is linked to the screen. A screen section is not a part of the form. This means that the same screen section definition can be used in different screens.

Screen sections can contain [screen section widgets](/t/Screen-Section-Widgets) like [Text Boxes](/t/Textbox), [Drop-down Boxes](/t/Drop-down-Box) etc. These controls can be grouped in [Group Boxes](/t/Group-Box) in order to make the interface more readable to the user. Screen sections cannot contain other screen sections.

When you add a new screen section, you will use the [User Interface Designer](/t/User-Interface-Designer).

# Usage

Screen sections can be referenced by

-   [Screens](/t/Screens) (one or more sections will be collected by the screen)
-   [Screen Reference Menu Items](/t/Screen-Menu-Item) (SelectionDialogPanel attribute)

# Example

You have an Invoice and InvoiceDetail entities. You need to create a screen section for each: InvoiceSection and InvoiceDetailSection. Each section will contain fields/widgets visible to the user. These two sections will be combined into an InvoiceScreen later, making it a master-detail screen.
