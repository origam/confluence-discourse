# User Interface Features

ORIGAM frontend contains out-of-the box enterprise-grade frontend. You can use it to provide great backoffice applications. Users can further configure their frontend by setting favorites, custom filters and views, data grouping and subtotals, etc.

The frontend automatically interprets business logic (e.g. offer states depending on state workflows) and security (disabling fields you are not allowed to edit). All without a need of any development.
