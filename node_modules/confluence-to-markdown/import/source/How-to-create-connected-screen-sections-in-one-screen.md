# How to create connected screen sections in one screen

Sometimes when you create a screen with more screen sections, you want the data to be connected, e. g. when you select one record in one screen section you want the other screen section to show corresponding data.

## Step-by-step guide

1.  Select one entity that will be the basis for other entities. Go to **Data Model** \> **Entities** \> **YourProject** and open the entity (or use right-click) and select **New** \> **Relationship**.
2.  As a **RelatedEntity** choose the entity you want connected and change **IsParentChild** to **True**.
3.  In the **Data Structures** go to the parent entity and add a new entity.

4.  If you don't have a screen section for the child entity, created it now.
5.  Go to **Screens** and open the screen of the parent entity. Using the widget SplitPanel or TabControl add the screen section of the child entity to the screen.
6.  In **Properties** of the screen section select the **DataMember** that is a child of the primary entity.
