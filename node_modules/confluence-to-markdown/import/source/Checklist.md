# Checklist

A Checklist is a widget made for displaying short lists where the user can select multiple options at once.

A Checklist has to be built on a child entity the same way as [TagInput](/t/TagInput). When an item is checked a new record is added to the child entity. When an item is unchecked, the record gets deleted.
