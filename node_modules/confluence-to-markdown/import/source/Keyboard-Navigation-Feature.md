# Keyboard Navigation Feature

ORIGAM user interface has been always optimized for keyboard input. Even the web client feels like working with a desktop application.

You can use keyboard shortcuts to

-   Add/delete/duplicate records
-   Switch [data views](/t/Data-Views-Feature)
-   Turn on filtering
-   Activate action buttons
