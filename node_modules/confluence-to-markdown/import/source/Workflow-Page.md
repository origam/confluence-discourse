# Workflow Page

Using Workflow API you can expose [sequential workflow](/t/Sequential-Workflows) functionality through the API. You would use this API typically where simple [Data Page](/t/Data-Page) would not provide enough functionality, e.g. when additional processing has to happen before storing the data into the database.

# Behavior

Sequential workflow API's currently do not return any data, although you can use the output contexts for managing where the HTTP request will be [redirected](/t/Redirect-Action) after workflow has finished.
