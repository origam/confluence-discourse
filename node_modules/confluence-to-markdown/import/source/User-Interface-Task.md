# User Interface Task

This task shows a [screen](/t/Screens) to the user. The workflow stops executing and waits until the user finishes interacting with the screen. The data loaded to the screen is based on the `OutputContextStore` value. The whole context is passed to the screen and displayed to the user. After the user finishes the interaction (by pressing the **Next** button), the data are merged back to the output context. Since `FullMerge` is selected by default, the output context will be updated so it is equal to the data of the screen when finished.

| Screen                   | Select the [screen](/t/Screens) you want to display to the user. The data structure of the screen must be equal to the data structure of the `OutputContextStore`.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **RefreshDataStructure** | Together with IsFinalForm=true and optionally *IsRefreshSuppressedBeforeFirstSave* when defined, it renders standard refresh button (rounded arrow) next to save button. When a user clicks on the refresh button, the *RefreshDataStructure* gets loaded by *RefreshMethod* and *RefreshSortSet* shown on the UI. |
| **RefreshMethod**        | Together with *RefreshDataStructure* and *RefreshSortSet* defines how to load the data when a user clicks on the refresh button (rounded arrow). If not defined, all unfiltered *RefreshDataStructure* data gets loaded.                                                                                           |
| **RefreshSortSet**       | Together with *RefreshDataStructure* and *RefreshMethod* defines how to load the data when a user clicks on the refresh button (rounded arrow). If not defined, *RefreshDataStructure* data getsh loaded unsorted.                                                                                                 |
| **RefreshParameters**    | Refresh parameters is a readonly collection of parameters needed for refreshing functionality of screen. Parameters can be added to the collection by adding child references (e.g. ContextStore reference) named as a parameters required for the filterset defined by RefreshMethod field.                       |
