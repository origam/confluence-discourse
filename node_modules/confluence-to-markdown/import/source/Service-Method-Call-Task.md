# Service Method Call Task

This task allows you to call any method of built-in or custom made [services](/t/Services) and to [pass data](/t/Passing-Values) to their parameters. If the services are based on ORIGAM Model metadata, the metadata references can be passed as parameters (e.g. [Report Reference](/t/Report-Reference) metadata to the [Report Service](/t/ReportService) or [Data Structure Reference](/t/Data-Structure-Reference) to the [Data Service](/t/DataService)).

| Service | Specifies which [service](/t/Services) will be called.   |

After adding a Service Method Call task, you have to map the method's parameters. See Passing Values for the different types of data you can pass to the service methods.
