# Custom Service Adapters

Custom service adapters allow you to implement your own business logic using a .NET DLL. This will allow you to e.g. connect to external data sources and service or provide calculations that would be hard to develop using XLST.In order to use a custom service adapter, you need to:

-   Develop and compile a .NET service agent DLL
-   Register your library under Business Logic / [Services](/t/Services) in ORIGAM Architect

You can also create you custom XSL and XPath functions that will be accessible within your own namespace.

# Registering In Model

After you develop the dll, you need to register it in ORIGAM model. You do this by adding an item in Business Logic \> Services.

1.  Add a new **Service** element and name it
2.  Fill in the the **Classpath** attribute with the full namespace and an assembly name, delimited by comma. E.g. `Origam.Security.Identity.IdentityServiceAgent,Origam.Security.Identity`
3.  Save the service and add methods under the service.
4.  Under each method you also need to specify its parameters.

# Exceptions

In case of an error the method should throw a standard .NET exception. In case of an exception the workflow will finish, data changes under transaction will be rolled back and rollback part of the workflow will be called eventually.
