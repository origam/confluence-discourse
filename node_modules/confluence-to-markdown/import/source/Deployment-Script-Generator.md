# Deployment Script Generator

Using this tool you can automate creation of database update scripts in a [Deployment Model](/t/Deployment) and also create new entities in a model by importing their definition based on the database tables.

When opened the tool will give you an overview of:

-   Objects missing in the database,
-   Objects missing in the application,
-   Objects that exist in both places but are different.

# Supported Object Types

-   Tables
-   Columns
-   Foreign key constraints
-   Indexes

# Supported Outputs

Using the tool you can generate the following scripts:

-   `CREATE TABLE` scripts for added entities
-   `ALTER TABLE ADD <column>` scripts for added fields
-   `ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT` for added foreign keys
-   `CREATE INDEX` for added indexes

You cannot use the tool to generate `ALTER` statements for changed column definitions or `DROP` statements for deleted columns or tables. You need to add these scripts manually by clicking on the deployment version and selecting **New \> [Service Command Update Activity](/t/Service-Command-Update-Activity)**.

# Generating Entities From Existing database Tables

When you have an existing database table from which you need to generate an entity you can do it by following these steps:

1.  Open the Deployment Script Generator.
2.  Change view to **Missing in Model**.
3.  Select the entities you want to import to the data model.
4.  Click **Add to Model** button.

Entities will be automatically created based on the database model.
