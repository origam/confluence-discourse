# Panel (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) has default sort set to column Name. This column does not exist in the panel. Cannot set default sort.

## Problem

When displaying a screen you get the following error: Panel (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) has default sort set to column Name. This column does not exist in the panel. Cannot set default sort.

## Solution

Possible reasons:

-   You have only one screen section on the screen on which you want to sort the data. The sort set specifies a sort field which is not present in your screen section as an input field. You need to add it.
-   You have multiple screen sections bound to the same DataMember in your screen. These sections display different parts of the entity. Only one of them must be configured with AllowAdd and AllowDelete. The one which allows navigation and AllowAdd must contain the sort field. The other sections must be configured that either the HideNavigationPanel = true or AllowAdd/AllowDelete = false.
