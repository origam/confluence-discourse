MergeType (Applicable only for action type Workflow or OpenForm with IsModalDialog=true). The merge takes place when the workflow finishes. It takes a context store from workflow (marked as IsReturn=true) and merges into the data of original screen. It works similarly with ActionType=OpenForm and Modal dialog. In that case the data (context store) of the last UI step of the modal dialog workflow is merged into original screen. Lets you name the merge contextstores *target* (original screen) and *incoming* (output from workflow, modal dialog)
