# How to Disable Some Action Buttons

[Actions](/t/Actions) are defined on the [entity](/t/Entities) level. When you combine more [Screen Sections](/t/Screen-Sections) on one [screen](/t/Screens), buttons from all the involved entities will be displayed.

There are two options on how to achieve this:

### Show Everywhere, Hide Sometimes

If you generally want to allow the buttons to be visible but on some screens you want to hide them, you can disable them per screen section:

1.  Open the screen
2.  Select the screen section bound to the entity of which the buttons should be hidden
3.  In Properties find **DisableActionButtons** and set it to **False**

Now for this section's entity the action buttons will not be shown.

### Show on One SCREEN Only

If there is a specific button designed only for one particular screen, you can directly limit the [UI Action](/t/Actions) by selecting the **Screen** item in the action's properties. By selecting a form you limit the action only to that screen.
