# Security

ORIGAM comes with security tools built-in and ready to use. It includes both authentication and authorization. The security subsystem is created to be customizable and it is possible to integrate with different authorization and authentication systems.

### [Authentication](/t/Authentication)

ORIGAM uses standard ASP.NET Identity http://www.asp.net/identity subsystem for authenticating users. This way it is independent and highly customizable.

### [Authorization](/t/Authorization)

Authorization subsystem allows the developer to assign access rights to multiple elements (e.g. menus, row-level-security filters etc.). The application's administrator can then assign these access rights to users at runtime, allowing them access to the desired functionality.
