# Map View Feature

Using the map view you can visualize geographical data. It is enough to have 1 geographical data field and 1 description field in order to define a map. You can optionally provide an Azimuth and Color fields.

Combined with an auto refresh feature you can create real-time object tracking (e.g. car tracking) applications.

You can define multiple map layers. You can connect to

-   Open Street Maps
-   [WMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service) standard map server

Filtering data in the table view will automatically filter data in the map view so you can easily analyze different sets of data.

# Example

Map view in an **editor mode** where you can place object on the map. There are also different layers available to turn on/off. If the layer is transparent it can be layered on top of a basic layer.
