# Kanban View Feature

With a kanban view you can pick a field by which you can horizontally organize your data. By doubleclicking a card you get to the [detail view](/t/Detail-View-Feature). You can define your own color for each column.

Filtering data in the table view will automatically filter data in the kanban view so you can easily analyze different sets of data.
