# Closing Active Web Page Tab

Origam has a feature, which allows to open HTML pages as tabs inside the Flash UI. We have introduced possibility to request FlashUI via JavaScript to close opened tab.To invoke a request a single line of JavaScript code is needed. Since the HTML pages are opened in the internal frames example code contains access to the main document. Flash UI has usually id `portal`.

**Invocation of closeActiveTab from internal frame**

``` js
window.top.document.getElementById("portal").closeActiveTab(); 
```
