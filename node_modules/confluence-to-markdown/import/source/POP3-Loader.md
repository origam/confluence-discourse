# 1. CONFIGURE POP3 LOADER

# 2. CONFIGURE CONNECTION STRING

The connection string can consist from the following parts:

|        |                                                                                                           |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| server | Url of the POP3 server (e.g. pop3.mycompany.com)                                                          |
| port   | POP3 server's port number (typically 110 or 995 for SSL encrypted)                                        |
| ssl    | If `True` then the connection will be encrypted (you would probably need to change also the port number). |
