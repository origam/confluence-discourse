# Standard Functions

You can use standard functions on the [entity level](/t/Entities) to define

-   [Calculated fields](/t/Function-Call-Field)
-   Entity [filters](/t/Filters)

Calculated fields will not be stored in a data store but their values are calculated by the system. The values will be recalculated by the front-end when changed by the user.

These functions are built-in and you cannot define your own functions.

If you need special calculations to take place or if you want to persist the calculated values you need to use [Data Structure Rule Sets](/t/Rule-Sets).

If you need special functions when defining filters, you need to use [Database Functions](/t/Database-Functions).
