# AsTree2

Using the Tree View widget you can easily edit complex tree structures. It supports the following operations:

-   Configure different entities (tables). E.g. Countries are stored in a Country table while Cities are stored in a City table.
-   Children can consist of records from different entities.
-   Add
-   Rename
-   Delete
-   Custom icons for different entities

In order to get the treeview working you need to design a [Tree Structure](/t/Tree-Structures).
