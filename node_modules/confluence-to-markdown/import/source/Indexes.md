# Indexes

In order to have a fast access to data, your database must have indexes defined. ORIGAM Architect allows you to store index definitions in the model, so they can be easily added to a database. Index definitions are generated for the database by the Deployment Script Generator and have no function inside the application server.

| GenerateDeploymentScript | When set to False the entity will be skipped by the [Deployment Script Generator](/t/Deployment-Script-Generator). This way you can design some indexes that will initially not be deployed, like optional unique indexes. These have to be then deployed manually but you can use the model for a reference. Default is `True`, the deployment script will be generated automatically. |

Indexes contain index keys, which define the fields the index is built on.
