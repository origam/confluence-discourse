# What is ORIGAM?

ORIGAM helps you address your enterprise user's requests and requirements with the least possible effort.

-   Are you in Excel hell?
-   Is your ERP supplier unable to add the supporting business process agenda for you?
-   Are your processes so specific that you are unable to find a reasonable supporting product?
-   Are you building enterprise software with a strong need for backoffice functionality?

ORIGAM is a set of tools that help you design, develop, deploy and run your enterprise applications. It offers you a customer-proven process of building application support for your business processes and in addition it gives you flexibility to deliver a custom application functionality where needed.

ORIGAM has a ready to use, fully functional user interface that your office users will love. Unless you are an UX expert you will not need a graphic designer.

Compared to traditional development processes (from scratch), using ORIGAM can be up to 10x more efficient.

ORIGAM.COM is not only a website - there is a lot of database stuff behind (partner portal, downloads).

It took us 3 days to migrate the basic web site from a custom PHP/MySQL application to a pure ORIGAM app. We were immediately able to:

-   Enter data in a nice backoffice-style ORIGAM GUI.
-   Speed-up the website response 10x.
-   Add new database features to the website easily using ORIGAM Architect.
