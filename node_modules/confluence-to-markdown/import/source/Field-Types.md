# Field Types

The following [field](/t/Fields) types can be created in the entity model:

### [Aggregated Field](/t/Aggregated-Field)

This field type allows you to create a calculated total field using an aggregate function.

### [Database Field](/t/Database-Field)

This model element maps an entity field to a physical, such as a database or a column.

### [Function Call Field](/t/Function-Call-Field)

This field type allows you to create a calculated field by calling a function.

### [Lookup Field](/t/Lookup-Field)

This type of field allows you to look up a value from another entity based on a field in the current entity using a lookup.

### [Virtual Field](/t/Virtual-Field)

This field type is not mapped to any physical database field.

| [Database Field](/t/Database-Field)     | Maps an entity field to a physical, e.g. a database or a column.                                                                                |
| [Virtual Field](/t/Virtual-Field)       | Provides a basic field type not mapped to a database. Can be used for in-memory operations.                                                     |
| [Function Call](/t/Function-Call-Field) | Calculates a value by calling a basic or a database [function](/t/Functions).                                 |
| [Aggregated Field](/t/Aggregated-Field) | Calculates a total value from child entities using an aggregate function.                                                                       |
| [Lookup Field](/t/Lookup-Field)         | Looks-up a value from another entity based on a field in the current entity using a [lookup](/t/Lookups). |
