# Can't save model because it crashes on memory error (System.OutOfMemoryException)

## Problem

Need to update a model. But when trying to save the updated model, memory error occures (System.OutOfMemoryException)

## Solution

The problem is caused most probably by system exhaustive DEBUG logging (log4net).

1.  Open application config (*AsapArchitect.exe.config*)
2.  Look at *\<log4net\>* configuration section and check logging levels.\\
3.  Change logging level *DEBUG* to *INFO*
